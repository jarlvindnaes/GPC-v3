          Product Connect exists to give manufacturers complete visibility across their entire value chain — and in the process, build lasting internal capability rather than expensive external dependency.
        </p>
        <h2>The Key Differentiator</h2>
        <p>
          We don't profit from your dependency. We profit from your capability. Traditional consultants do the work for you and keep you weak. Product Connect builds the system that lets you do it yourself — and get strong.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>With consultants:</strong> You rent expertise. You learn nothing. You start from scratch every time.</li>
          <li><strong>With Product Connect:</strong> Your team does the reps. They call suppliers. They learn material flows. They understand impact. Twelve months in, they're not just compliant — they're competent.</li>
